# hiiiii welcome to the wordweaver code repositoryyyyyy

this is a kinda simple project I made about cellular automata https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_cellular_automaton after 
watching emergent garden's youtube video on it. Ive always wanted to play around with embedded javascript and also dynamic patterns
and also text->image generation code and also cellular patterns and also color interactions so this project is a pretty
fun one.
